Statistical Arbitrage Strategy Using Mean Reversion and Cointegration Tests

# Market-Neutral Pairs Trading: Visa (V) vs Mastercard (MA)

> Mean-reversion strategy on the **Vâ€“MA** pair with robust walk-forward validation, volatility targeting, and risk/stress analysis.  
> **Walk-forward OOS** (fixed thresholds, disjoint quarters): **Sharpe â‰ˆ 0.57**.  
> **Vol-targeted variant** (10% ann target): **Sharpe â‰ˆ 0.75**.

## ðŸ”Ž TL;DR
- **Pair:** Visa (V) & Mastercard (MA)  
- **Signal:** log-spread *z-score* with cross-entry and exit band  
- **Backtest:** next-bar execution, **5 bps/leg** costs, ADF gating, min-trades rule  
- **Walk-forward:** train â‰ˆ 2y, test â‰ˆ 3m (disjoint), Î² re-fit each train window  
- **Best variant:** vol-targeted (10% ann, 60-day vol, leverage cap 2Ã—) â†’ **Sharpe ~0.75**, **MaxDD ~âˆ’10.6%**  
- **Diversification:** near-zero to negative market beta in 2024; very low factor RÂ²

## ðŸ§  What this project does

- Builds a **log-price spread** of Visa and Mastercard via OLS hedge ratio (Î²), validates **cointegration** (Engleâ€“Granger ADF + Johansen).  
- Trades a **z-score mean-reversion** signal with **cross-entry** and an **exit band**; realistic **transaction costs** modeled (5 bps per leg on regime changes).  
- Performs **walk-forward** validation (train ~2 years â†’ test ~3 months, disjoint), re-estimating Î² each train window, with **ADF gating** and a **minimum trades** constraint to avoid degenerate fits.  
- Implements a **volatility-targeted** variant (target 10% annualized, 60-day vol, leverage cap 2Ã—).  
- Extends to a small **multi-pair portfolio** gated by stationarity and half-life.  
- Evaluates performance (equity, drawdowns, rolling Sharpe), **sub-periods & regimes** (SPY 200-day, VIX quartiles), and **factor exposures** (SPY/QQQ/IWM/MTUM/VLUE/USMV/HYG/IEF).

## âœ… Why the project is useful

- Showcases an **end-to-end quant workflow**: hypothesis â†’ stationarity tests â†’ signal design â†’ robust OOS validation â†’ risk/factor analysis.  
- Demonstrates **overfitting control** (disjoint walk-forward, ADF gate, parameter-grid robustness).  
- Produces a **diversifying return stream** (low/negative market beta late-sample) and documents where the strategy performs best (sideways/high-vol regimes).  
- Fully **reproducible** with standard Python libraries and Yahoo Finance data.
